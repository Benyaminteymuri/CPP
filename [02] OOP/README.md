## Differences between C and C++

As follow we summerized the diffrence between C and C++:

| C | C++ | Level |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | 
| printf | cout | basic |
| scanf | cin | basic |
| XXX | bool | basic |
| ... | function overloading | intemidiate |
| XXX | function(deafult) | intemidiate |
| XXX | functions inside a struct | intemidiate |
| XXX | same name local and global function and variable | intemidiate |
| XXX | define small scops with same name varible in diffrent scope | intemidiate |
| XXX | better memory leak managment | intemidiate |
| XXX | OOP | advance |
